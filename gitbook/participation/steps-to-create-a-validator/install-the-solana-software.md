# Install the Solana software

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: Before installing the Solana software, make sure you’ve generated your validator identity keypair, as described [here](validator-public-key-registration.md).
{% endhint %}

Before attempting to connect your validator to the Tour de SOL cluster, be familiar with connecting a validator to the Public Testnet as described [here](https://docs.solana.com/book/running-validator).

You can confirm the version running on the cluster entrypoint by running:

```text
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0","id":1,"method":"getVersion"}' tds.solana.com:8899
```
